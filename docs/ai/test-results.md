## Step 1 — Structural checks

| Check                                              | Result |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `L0_repo_card.md` ≤ 50 lines                       | Pass (36) |
| All 8 L1 files present                             | Pass |
| Each L1 has purpose blockquote + Related Deep Dives| Pass (8/8) |
| L1 line counts in 80–200 target                    | **Below target** (39–82) — see note |
| L2 `_index.md` present                             | Pass |
| Each L2 opens with "When to Read This" callout     | Pass (2/2) |
| Relative links resolve (`docs/ai/` + AGENTS.md)   | Pass (42 checked, 0 broken) |
| AGENTS.md has How to Load / Git Conventions / Doc Commands | Pass |

**Note on L1 line counts:** files are table-dense and information-complete but
run 39–82 lines, mostly under the 80–200 soft target. The standard favors tables
over prose and warns against bloat, so they were left concise rather than padded.
One file (06_interfaces.md) reaches 82 lines. Accepted deviation; revisit if a
section needs more depth.

## Step 2/3 — Question runs

Questions span the five standard categories. Each answer was checked against the
repo source before being marked Pass. "Level" is the lowest disclosure level
that fully answers the question.

### Setup & Build

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | How do I install and run it locally? | `bun run setup` then `bun run dev` (backend :8000 + web :3000). | `L1/01_setup.md` ↔ `package.json` scripts | L1 | Pass |
| 2 | Which env vars are required? | `AGORA_APP_ID`, `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`. | `L1/01_setup.md`/`06_interfaces.md` ↔ `agent.py`, `.env.example` | L1 | Pass |
| 3 | Is this zero-key? | Yes — `OPENAI_API_KEY` is optional; Agora manages the OpenAI key by default. | `L1/01_setup.md`, `07_gotchas.md` ↔ `README.md`, `agent.py` | L1 | Pass |

### Test & Run

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 4 | How do I run backend tests without cloud creds? | `cd server && pytest tests -v`; `conftest.py` fakes env + SDK session. | `L1/04_conventions.md`, `01_setup.md` ↔ `tests/conftest.py` | L1 | Pass (ran: 2 passed) |
| 5 | What's the narrowest gate for a web-only change? | `bun run verify:web`. | `L1/05_workflows.md` ↔ `package.json` | L1 | Pass |
| 6 | What does `verify:local:fastapi` do? | Spawns real FastAPI with `FakeAgent` and proxies routes through the rewrite map. | `L1/03_code_map.md`, `05_workflows.md` ↔ `web/scripts/verify-local-fastapi.ts` | L1 | Pass |

### Conventions

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 7 | What response shape do backend routes use? | `{ code, msg, data }`; `data` only when there's a payload. | `L1/04_conventions.md`, `06_interfaces.md` ↔ `server.py` | L1 | Pass |
| 8 | How are errors mapped to HTTP codes? | `ValueError→400`, `RuntimeError→500`, else 500 via `_to_http_error`. | `L1/04_conventions.md` ↔ `server.py` | L1 | Pass |
| 9 | What are the commit/branch conventions? | Conventional commits `type: description`; branches `type/short-description`; no AI tool names. | `AGENTS.md` Git Conventions | L1 | Pass |

### Development

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 10 | How do I change the translation language pair? | Change `SOURCE_LANG` (Deepgram BCP-47), `TARGET_LANG` (prompt name), and `TTS_VOICE` (MiniMax voice) together. | `L1/05_workflows.md`, `07_gotchas.md` ↔ `agent.py`, `.env.example` | L1 | Pass |
| 11 | Where is the `/api/*` boundary defined and what must I not add? | Rewrites in `web/next.config.ts`; never add `app/api/**/route.ts` for agent/token logic. | `L1/04_conventions.md`, `07_gotchas.md` ↔ `next.config.ts`, `verify-api-contracts.ts` | L1 | Pass |
| 12 | Where does token generation live? | `server/` (`generate_convo_ai_token` in `server.py`); App Certificate stays server-side. | `L1/02_architecture.md`, `08_security.md` ↔ `server.py` | L1 | Pass |

### Deep Dive

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 13 | How is VAD configured and where? | `turn_detection` dict on `AgoraAgent(...)` in `agent.py` with `speech_threshold`, `start_of_speech`, `end_of_speech` VAD config — not on the `OpenAI` vendor. | `L2/translation_config.md` ↔ `agent.py` | L2 | Pass |
| 14 | How is the translation system prompt built and injected? | `build_translation_system_messages(target_lang)` in `translation_config.py` returns a single system message; injected via `OpenAI(system_messages=...)` in `Agent.start()`. | `L2/translation_config.md` ↔ `translation_config.py`, `agent.py`, `test_translation_config.py` | L2 | Pass |
| 15 | How does stop survive a backend restart? | `_sessions` is in-memory; missing session falls back to `client.stop_agent(agent_id)`. | `L2/session_lifecycle.md` ↔ `agent.py` | L2 | Pass |

## Step 4 — Analysis

- All 15 questions answered at the expected disclosure level (12 at L1, 3 at L2).
  No "correct but needed L2 unnecessarily" or "wrong/missing L2" cases.
- No missing-coverage findings; no broken references (42 links, 0 broken).
- One soft deviation: L1 line counts mostly below the 80–200 target (accepted; concise/table-dense).

## Step 5 — Summary

| Category       | Questions | Pass | Notes |
| -------------- | :-------: | :--: | ----- |
| Setup & Build  | 3 | 3 | — |
| Test & Run     | 3 | 3 | backend tests executed: 2 passed |
| Conventions    | 3 | 3 | — |
| Development    | 3 | 3 | — |
| Deep Dive      | 3 | 3 | resolved at L2 as designed |
| **Total**      | **15** | **15** | — |

## Step 6 — Fixes / Retest

No failing questions; no fixes required. Evidence executed during this run:

- `pytest tests -v` (throwaway venv `/tmp/v_translator`) → `2 passed`.
- Relative link check → `42 checked, 0 broken`.
