# Deep Dive — Session Lifecycle

> **When to Read This:** You are touching client-side join, token renewal, RTC/RTM wiring, transcript handling, or mid-call control. For the contracts these calls hit, see [06_interfaces](../06_interfaces.md).

The browser owns the full RTC/RTM client lifecycle; the backend owns tokens and the agent session. The two meet only at `/api/*`.

## End-to-end flow

1. **Config** — `LandingPage.tsx` calls `getConfig()` (`web/src/services/api.ts`) → `GET /api/get_config`. Backend mints a Token007 (RTC+RTM, 3600s) for a concrete non-zero UID and returns `{ app_id, token, uid, channel_name, agent_uid }`.
2. **Join** — `ConversationComponent.tsx` joins the RTC channel with the returned token/UID, publishes the microphone, and logs in to RTM.
3. **Start agent** — `startAgent(channelName, rtcUid, userUid)` → `POST /api/startAgent`. Backend validates credentials, builds the vendor chain, starts the async session, and returns `agent_id`.
4. **Converse** — user speaks in `SOURCE_LANG`; Deepgram STT transcribes; OpenAI translates to `TARGET_LANG`; MiniMax TTS plays back. RTM delivers transcript + metrics.
5. **Stop** — `stopAgent(agentId)` → `POST /api/stopAgent`. The client also releases RTC/RTM media on end-call.

## Backend session bookkeeping

`Agent` (`server/src/agent.py`) keeps an in-memory map `self._sessions[agent_id] = session`.

- `stop(agent_id)` pops the session and calls `session.stop()`.
- If the session is missing (e.g. process restarted), it falls back to `self.client.stop_agent(agent_id)` — the stateless cloud path. This is why stop is robust across restarts but `_sessions` itself is **not** a durable store.

## Transcript handling (`web/src/lib/conversation.ts`)

- `normalizeTranscript(transcript, localUid)` — maps `uid === '0'` to the local UID and runs `normalizeTranscriptSpacing` on text.
- `normalizeTimestampMs(ts)` — promotes second-precision timestamps to ms.
- `getMessageList` / `getCurrentInProgressMessage` — split finalized vs in-progress turns (by `TurnStatus.IN_PROGRESS`).
- `mapAgentVisualizerState(agentState, isConnected, connectionState)` — maps SDK state → UIKit visualizer state (`joining`, `listening`, `analyzing`, `talking`, `ambient`, `disconnected`).

## What transcript shows in the translator

The transcript panel shows both the original (user) and translated (agent) turns as they stream in over RTM. The agent turn carries the translated text; the user turn carries the transcribed source-language speech. Both are normalized through `normalizeTranscript`.

## Token renewal

Tokens expire at 3600s. The client re-fetches config / renews as needed in `LandingPage.tsx`; renewal uses the same `get_config` contract. Keep renewal client-side — the backend stays stateless about who is connected.

## What stays where

- **Client owns:** RTC join, mic publish, RTM login, transcript/metrics/state listeners, token renewal, explicit end-call media release.
- **Backend owns:** token minting, vendor chain build, session start/stop.
- Do not move token logic into the web app or add Route Handlers for it (see [07_gotchas](../07_gotchas.md)).
